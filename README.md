# My Personal Website (Still need to host it)
---

This is my personal portfolio website I built with React and styled with CSS, it has a link to my social media (LinkedIn/Instagram) as well as to my github, a button that allows you to download my resume, a contact form which when submitted sends me an email, my portfolio hosted on a carousel that takes you to the appropriate GitHub pages for those projects, and a short about me section which will be updated as I learn more :)
